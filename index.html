## **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

### **The Challenge**
Electronics A-level is **not available** in Liverpool-area colleges. Your son needs alternative pathways to prepare for an electronics career whilst maintaining entrepreneurial opportunities.

### **Five Strategic Pathways Identified**

| Pathway | Duration | Cost | Earning Start | Best For |
|---------|----------|------|---------------|----------|
| **University Route** | 6-7 years | £30,000+ debt | Age 21+ | Deep technical expertise |
| **Entrepreneurial Focus** | 4-5 years | £5,000-15,000 | Age 18+ | Business + tech skills |
| **Degree Apprenticeship** ⭐ | 4-5 years | **EARN £72-104k** | Age 16+ | Industry experience + degree |
| **Liverpool UTC/Studio** | 2-3 years | Minimal | Age 18+ | Local industry connections |
| **Traditional Apprenticeship** | 3-4 years | **EARN £45-75k** | Age 16+ | Immediate practical skills |

### **Recommended Action Plan**
1. **IMMEDIATE** (August 2025): Secure sixth form place and start A-levels in September 2025
